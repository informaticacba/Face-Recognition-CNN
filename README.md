A real-time facial expression recognition system through webcam streaming and CNN

## Environment
I provide my work environment for references.

CPU : i5-6500  
GPU : nvidia GTX 960 2G  
RAM : 8G  
OS  : Ubuntu 16.04  

## Installation
I strongly recommend you to use [`Anaconda`](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which is a package manager and provides python virtual environment.  
After you install Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with python 3.4.
```
conda create -n env-name python=3.4
```
you can also check if your env. has been created by,
```
conda info --envs
```
You should activate your virtual environment in different way corresponding to your operating system.
For example, In Ubuntu, you can activate your virtual environment by,
```
source activate env-name
```
